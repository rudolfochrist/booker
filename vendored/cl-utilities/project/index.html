  <h2>A collection of semi-standard utilities</h2>

 <h3>Introduction</h3>

 <p>On Cliki.net, there is a collection of <a
href="http://www.cliki.net/Common%20Lisp%20Utilities">Common Lisp
Utilities</a>, things that everybody writes since they're not part of
the official standard. There are some very useful things there; the
only problems are that they aren't implemented as well as you'd like
(some aren't implemented at all) and they aren't conveniently packaged
and maintained. It takes quite a bit of work to carefully implement
utilities for common use, commented and documented, with error
checking placed everywhere some dumb user might make a mistake.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://clrfi.alu.org/">CLRFI process</a> is a lot better
thought out, and will probably produce better standards than informal
discussion on a Wiki, but it has one problem: at the time of this
writing, it's not doing anything yet. Until the CLRFI process gets
going, I think that a high-quality collection of the informal
standards on Cliki is a valuable thing to have. It's here, and it's
called cl-utilities.</p>
